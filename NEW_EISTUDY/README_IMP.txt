ROVER CONTROL PROGRAM:

This program allows you to control a rover on a grid with obstacles.

Instructions:
1. Enter the grid size in the format "width height" (e.g., 10 10).
2. Enter the starting position of the rover in the format "x, y, direction" (e.g., 0,0,N).
3. Enter the commands for the rover's movement (e.g., M, M, R, M, L, M).
4. Optionally, enter obstacles in the format "x1,y1; x2,y2" (e.g., 2,2; 3,5).


The result will be displayed in a new window, showing the final position of the rover and a status report.
GUI:
Note: Make sure to install the required libraries before running the program. You can install tkinter using the following command:
pip install tk(IF AND ONLY IF GUI IS NEEDED)..
